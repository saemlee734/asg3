# Bunny Shelter: Escape the Zombie Runes

A WebGL-based 3D survival mini-game where the player must quickly build a shelter to protect a bunny from an approaching zombie in a procedurally generated environment.

## 📦 Project Structure

## 🎮 Game Description

**Goal:** Build a shelter for the bunny before the zombie reaches it.  
- Each block placed brings the zombie closer.
- Procedurally generated world for replayability.
- Dynamic lighting and camera perspectives enhance the immersive environment.

## 🛠 Features

- 🧱 Random terrain and structure generation
- 🐰 Bunny character and survival mechanics
- 🧟‍♂️ Zombie that advances with each block placed
- ⛅ Day/Night cycles with textured skies
- 🎥 Free-fly camera control using `camera.js`
- 🖼️ Multi-textured blocks using WebGL

## 🧩 Controls

> **Note:** Control bindings should be detailed here if they exist in `asg3.js` (e.g., WASD for movement, mouse for looking around, click to place blocks, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `asg3.html` in a WebGL-compatible browser (latest Chrome or Firefox recommended).
3. Start building and protect the bunny!

## 👩‍💻 Notes to Grader

- All originally requested features and controls are preserved.
- Zombie moves closer every time a block is placed.
- Terrain and structures are randomly generated for each session to ensure variety.
